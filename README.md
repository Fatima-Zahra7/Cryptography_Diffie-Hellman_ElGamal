# Cryptography_Diffie-Hellman_ElGamal

This project includes implementations of two fundamental cryptographic algorithms: **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange** and **ElGamal Encryption**. Both algorithms are widely used in secure communication protocols to ensure data confidentiality and integrity.

## Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

In the **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**, two parties can securely exchange cryptographic keys over an insecure channel, allowing them to establish a shared secret. This shared secret can then be used to encrypt further communication without the need to directly transmit the secret key itself.

### Steps of Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange:

1. **Agree on public parameters**: Both parties agree on a large prime number (`p`) and a base (`g`), which are used in all calculations. These are public and can be transmitted openly.

2. **Private key selection**: Each party selects a private key. This private key is kept secret and is never transmitted.

3. **Generate public keys**: Each party computes a public key by raising the base (`g`) to the power of their private key, modulo the prime number (`p`). This public key is then shared with the other party.

4. **Compute the shared secret**: Each party takes the other party's public key and raises it to the power of their own private key, modulo `p`. This results in a shared secret that is the same for both parties, even though the key was never directly exchanged.

The **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange** algorithm enables secure communication without the need to transmit sensitive information, thus reducing the risk of interception by unauthorized parties.

### Implementation in this project:
- The implementation uses the **Miller-Rabin primality test** for generating large prime numbers.
- It allows users to select the key size (128, 256, 512, or 1024 bits) and generates the required prime numbers and public keys.
- The private keys are securely generated, and the shared secret is computed for both parties (e.g., Alice and Bob), ensuring that both derive the same secret key for encryption.

## ElGamal Encryption

The **ElGamal Encryption** system is a public-key cryptosystem that provides encryption and decryption through asymmetric key pairs. It is based on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol but adds encryption/decryption steps.

### Steps of ElGamal Encryption:

1. **Key Generation**: A large prime number `p` and a generator `g` are selected, just like in Diffie-Hellman. A private key `x` is selected randomly, and the corresponding public key `y = g^x mod p` is computed.

2. **Encryption**: To encrypt a message, the sender chooses a random value `k` and computes two values:
    - `c1 = g^k mod p` (which is part of the ciphertext)
    - `c2 = m * y^k mod p` (where `m` is the plaintext message).

   The ciphertext consists of the pair `(c1, c2)`.

3. **Decryption**: The receiver uses their private key `x` to decrypt the ciphertext. The decryption involves computing the shared secret `s = c1^x mod p` and using it to recover the original message `m = c2 * s^(-1) mod p`.

ElGamal encryption provides semantic security, meaning that even if an attacker intercepts the ciphertext, they cannot deduce any information about the plaintext without the private key.

### Implementation in this project:
- The **ElGamal encryption** implementation generates the necessary public and private keys.
- The system allows the encryption of a plaintext message with the recipient's public key and provides the decryption process using their private key.
