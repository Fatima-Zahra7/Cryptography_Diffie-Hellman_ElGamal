# Cryptography_Diffie-Hellman_Exchange

In this project, I will implement the Diffie-Hellman algorithm in a simple manner. The Diffie-Hellman key exchange is a method of securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel. It allows two parties to generate a shared secret key, which can be used for encrypted communication, without having to transmit the key itself.

The basic steps of the Diffie-Hellman algorithm are as follows:
1. Both parties agree on a large prime number and a base (generator).
2. Each party selects a private key and computes a public key using the base raised to the power of their private key, modulo the prime number.
3. The public keys are exchanged between the parties.
4. Each party uses the received public key and their own private key to compute the shared secret key.

This shared secret key can then be used for symmetric encryption to ensure secure communication.
